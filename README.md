# Useful Tools
Useful tools I've created either originally or heavily modified from smart people on stackoverflow or anywhere else. I will always give credit where it is due.

Most of these tools are still written in bash with the most basic linux inclusions to minimize/eliminate the need to do anything other than copy from git and run.
